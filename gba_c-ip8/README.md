# GBAC-ip8
I'm going to try to write a Chip8 interpreter for the GBA

The controls are a bit wonky right now, but they are explained in `main.asm`, you will have to just figure out for now...

In order to quit a game and return to the menu screen, press `start` and `select` at the same time on the GBA.

The SRAM option in the menu does not do anything for now, but the idea was to add an option that you can load any chip 8 rom as save file into a GBA emulator, and play the rom!
